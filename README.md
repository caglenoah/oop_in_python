Take a look at the Brawler class and the fight function provided. In the main function, create 4 new brawlers with the following stats:

Name: Aragorn. Speed: 4. Strength: 4.
Name: Gimli. Speed: 2. Strength: 7.
Name: Legolas. Speed: 7. Strength: 7.
Name: Frodo. Speed: 3. Strength: 2.
Then call fight twice. The first fight should be Aragorn vs Gimli. The second will be Legolas vs Frodo.
