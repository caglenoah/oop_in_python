ASSIGNMENT
One of the greatest sins when trying to write "clean code" is using misleading names for your variables and functions. Take a look at the destroy_wall function. Based on its name, you might assume that it destroys a single wall, but if you look closely, you'll see that it handles multiple walls.

The test suite expects a different function name. Take a look at the main_test.py file to see what it's looking for, and rename the function accordingly.

Additionally, try to rename the variables inside the function to be more descriptive. After passing the tests, take a look at the solution to see how we named everything.
